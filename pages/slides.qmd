## Caveats

- Work in progress!
- Recording will quickly become out-of-date
- Verify/fix code before use

## Definitions

Reprojection - changing the projection of a dataset from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to another

## Grid structures


- Rectilinear - described by one-dimensional latitude and longitude coordinates
    - Regular - described by one x,y coordinate and the resolution
- Curvilinear - described by two-dimensional latitude and longitude coordinates
- Unstructured - Grids in which the grid coordinates require a list of nodes

## Resampling algorithms

- Nearest neighbor
- Bilinear
- Cubic
- Spline
- Inverse distance
- Bucket / binning (average, min, max, mode, med, quartile, sum, rms)
- Spectral
- Triangulation
- Conservative

## Some of the many reasons to warp resample

Co-registering datasets

- Mosaicing
- Statistical analyses
- Machine learning

Visualization

- Rendering (minimize distortion)
- Building overviews

## Observations and opinions

- Lots of kernels were killed in the making of this presentation
    - we need a demo using a bounded-memory  approach (Cubed!)
- There are some awesome data cube libraries in Python
    - let's work with the developers to make them even better...and not build another one
- Xarray's data model is intuitive for a lot of people
    - use accessors to extend it's functionality rather than a new data class

## What's next for the guide

- Try caching weights
- Small tile from a large dataset
- Add information about grid structures supported
- Add information about resampling methods supported
- Test with virtualized data
- Test with cloud optimized data
- Test with other resampling algorithms

## Thanks

- Development Seed
- Pangeo Community
    - special thanks to Justus, Michael, and Deepak
- NASA IMPACT

## What's next for resampling in Python

Let's discuss!
